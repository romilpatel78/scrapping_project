Experience using Jupyter notebooks
Experience working with large or fast moving data sets
Qualified for one of the the specializations below
Specialization: Machine Learning
Scikit-learn expert: This means you have rolled your own transformers and estimators, which you chained together in a pipeline and found optimal hyperparameters via a randomized grid search (or some other method).
Pandas and Numpy expert: You have used pandas enough to run into its rough parts. Very likely you read Wes’ book. You are fluent with Numpy and array oriented programming in general.
Modern techniques: You are deeply familiar with different validation pitfalls, understand how to effectively ensemble several models, and have experimented with different hyperparameter optimization methods.
Modern data: You have built models using unstructured data such as text or images. You have built time series models using econometric approaches as well as machine learning approaches. Deep algorithmic understanding: You know all the nitty-gritty details of your favorite machine learning algorithms.
Specialization: Marketing
Statistical rigor: You should have a solid foundation of the statistics behind standard statistical design methods such as A/B testing and multivariate testing. For example, you should know how to deal with clustering and should be able to determine the standard errors of different statistics through simulation.
Multi-armed bandit models: You know how to implement the technique and how to write a good cost function.
Modern techniques: You can build a model that powers an app that serves a unique arrangement of diverse components to each user such that the specific components served were chosen to maximize the specific user’s probability of selecting a call to action (i.e. using machine learning to identify complex heterogenous treatment effects).
War stories: You must be able to talk about times you ran experiments in a complex environment and what you learned from the effort
Specific experience in marketing optimization is a plus.
Specialization: Insurance
Industry experience: You have solid P&C experience and have had a significant role in building either pricing or underwriting models.
